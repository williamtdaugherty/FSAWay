//FSAWay website terms and conditions//

Privacy Policy

Effective October 1st, 2015

Goal

FSAWay's primary goal in collecting information is to use such information to assist us in serving you. We also request information in order to provide and improve our web site, services, features and content, and to administer our relationship with you (together, the “Service”)

General

This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, or your other communications to us.

We update this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will continue to treat information according to the terms of the policy that was in place when the information was collected. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy by posting a new Privacy Policy on our Site and we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of any new terms.

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis, and using or touching information in any way, including but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing, and transferring information within the United States or internationally.


Log Data.

When you visit the Site, whether as a subscriber or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This log data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the website from which you are visiting, pages of our site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, and other statistics. We may use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase the Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Site to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you, and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to you and your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.

Cookies

Like many websites, we will use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we will utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we will utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site, and to monitor aggregate usage by Virgin America Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you disconnect from the Site and Service and close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser,by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.

E-mailing

As part of the Service, we intend to create features to enable you to send e-mails via the Site, the IFE system or our other intermediaries. The e-mail addresses that you provide will be used only for the purpose of sending your e-mails to the recipients. FSAWay will not otherwise e-mail those recipients, unless they have independently opted to receive e-mails from us.

If you would like to continue to receive FSAWay/Elevate marketing and promotion emails and avoid having them be classified as spam, please add info@FSAWay.com to your address book or safe list now.

Unsubscribe

We realize you are a User and your email inbox might be quite full. We will promptly update your contact preferences. However, please note that any request to update your personal information may take up to 10 days for your electronic request and 6-8 weeks for your postal mail request.

Please do not reply to the info@FSAWay.com email address because it is an unmonitored alias. If you have web site-related questions, suggestions, or comments, please e-mail us at webteam@FSAWay.com.

Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to FSAWay. Accordingly, safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

Information Sharing and Disclosure


Subscribers.

When you register through the Site, contribute to the Site or IFE system, or communicate with other users, we may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, and improvement of the Site’s features), or to assist us in analyzing the use of our Site and Service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. FSAWay cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose your Personal Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas and notice of class certification), to protect the property and rights of FSAWay or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.

Business Transfers. FSAWay may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. If the new entity wishes to make additional uses of your information different from those described in this Privacy Policy you will have the opportunity to decline such use at that time.


Changing or Deleting Your Information

All subscribers may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging onto your account. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. See below for privacy contact information.
